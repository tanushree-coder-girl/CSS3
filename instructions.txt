-------------CSS3 From Beginer To Advanced----------

1. Introduction 
    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
    It is Used to style Any Web page.
    File name must be saved with a extension named as style.css 

2. Syntax
    selector {
        property : value;   //Declaration
    }

3. How To Add Css
    There are three ways of inserting a style sheet.
        1. External CSS
            example => <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

        2. Internal CSS
            example =>  <head>
                            <style>
                                h1{
                                    color: red;
                                }
                            </style>
                        </head>

        3. Inline CSS
            example => <h1 style="color:red">Welcome in Css Tutorial</h1>
 
        Point to be noted => 1. Always Gives first priority to Inline Style
                             2. Then Check order of internal and external what comes at last then last one is shown in output. 

4. Css Simple and Basics selectors
     Simple selectors
        example =>  1. id denotes as #idname
                    2. class denotes as .classname ,
                    3. element like p, h1, div, span etc
        note=> 1. Gives first priority to id Then class and at last element. and check order also.
        The Advanced selectors is discussed in bottom at line 

5. Css Comments
    css comment is written inside    /* code goes here */
    /* This is a single-line comment */
    /*
    This is
    a multi-line
    comment
     */

6. CSS Color
    Colors Can Be specified Using 
        1. predefined Color Names like red , green , blue etc
            note=> There are 140 + Standard predefined colors.

        2. RGB like rgb(red, green, blue);
            note=> Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color between 0 and 255.
                    for black use rgb (0,0,0); and for white use rgb (255,255,255);

        3. RGBA like rgba(red, green, blue, alpha) 
            note=> The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all):
                    example => rgba(255 , 255 , 0 , 0.5);

        4. HEX like #rrggbb 
            note=> hexadecimal color is specified with: #RRGGBB, where the RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue)
                   for black use #000000 and for white use #ffffff
                   Sometimes you will see a 3-digit hex code in the CSS source. whixh is same as #rgb #f0f as #ff00ff

        5. HSL like hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)
            note=> Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.
                   Saturation is a percentage value, 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.
                   Lightness is also a percentage, 0% is black, 50% is neither light or dark, 100% is white
                   for black use hsl(0, 0, 0); and for white use hsl(0, 0, 100%);

        6. HSLA like hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)
                The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all):
                example => hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.5)
